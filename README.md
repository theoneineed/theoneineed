## About Me
I am a graduate student pursuing a PhD in Physics. My field of research is Computational Physics.

I have always been very interested in problem solving, and always needed to know answers to all the "why" questions I had since I was little. So, science (mainly, Physics) was the obvious route to take for my career. I was introduced to programming in middle school and the euphoria followed by the completion of a coding problem was second to none. I consider myself quite fortunate to be in a day and age that I don't have to choose only one of the topics that interest me, for my career. 

I am particularly interested in the field of statistical algorithm development and quantum computing. I have invested quite some time to hone my skills in the field of data science and rising field of quantum computing. My most experiences have come from my involvement in academic research. I have worked in developing unsupervised clustering algorithms during my time as an undergrad and am currently working on compiling these algorithms into a single publishable package.

I am most familiar with Python, but I also work with Julia and, MatLab. I have spent some time learning ForTran, because of the importance of the language in scientific programming. 

In short, I am a Physicist who likes programming ...
